## Local Development

From the repository root:

```
cd eldeetech
npm install

# Start Vite (frontend) and local API (Express) together
npm run dev:all
```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:8080 and proxies API requests to http://localhost:3000.

- API route for mail: POST /api/send-mail
- Local API server source: `eldeetech/api/dev-server.js` (reuses the Vercel handler)

Environment variables for local development go in `eldeetech/.env`:

- ZOHO_USER, ZOHO_PASS
- optional: ZOHO_SMTP_HOST, ZOHO_SMTP_PORT, TO_PRIMARY, TO_CC, EMAIL_TZ, EMAIL_FOOTER_IMAGE_URL
